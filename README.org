#+TITLE: MEMO

* About
MEMO provides macros for defining functions that memoize calls to them.  It also provides the
ability to locally memoize existing functions that were specially and lexically bound.

Maintenance of memoization tables is provided by the garbage collector.

** API
\[Macro]\\
*defmemo* /name/ /args/ &body /body/

Define a function /name/ that memoizes calls based on its argument list.

\[Macro]\\
*lambda-memo* /args/ &body /body/

Define an anonymous function that memoizes calls based on its argument list.

\[Macro]\\
*with-memoization* /functions/ &body /body/

Locally memoize listed /functions/ in the lexical scope of /body/.  Calls to these functions must
either appear in the function position or be named with sharp-quote, not quote.
